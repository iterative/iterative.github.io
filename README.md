# Iterative GitHub Pages

This repository tells GitHub to set the default pages root of all org repos to https://docs.iterative.ai/.

For example, enabling GH pages in `https://github.com/iterative/SOME_REPO/settings/pages` will render the site at `https://docs.iterative.ai/SOME_REPO/` unless specified otherwise.
